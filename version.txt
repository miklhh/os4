--- Version information ---

-- Version 1.3.1 2017-06-16
 - Added 'syscall 2 - sleep' to the syscalls.
 - Changed syscall gate type from interrupt gate to trap gate.
 - Made GDT allocation dynamic.

-- Version 1.3.0 2017-06-15
 - Release-name changed from 'Alpha' to 'Version' to indicate that the OS is 
   no-where near completed.
 - Systemcall interface added and briefly tested.
 - Seperated the libk library into the two new libc and libk.
 - Added MIT-license to the project.

-- Alpha 1.2.2
 - Method for switching to usermode added.
 - Started working on a new paging system.
Also some additional small changes to the code has been done.


-- Alpha 1.2.1
 - Super basic keyboard driver added.


-- Alpha 1.2.0
 - Heap allocation function 'kmalloc' and 'kfree' added.
Heap allocation for the kernel has finally been added, and some test with it has been done.
It seems to behave normaly.


-- Alpha 1.1.1 2017-02-20
 - Fixed the sleep function.
With the sleep function fixed, the os behaves the same on VirtualBox as on QEMU.


-- Alpha 1.1.0 2017-02-19
 - Code for interrupts added.
 - Code for PIC added.
 - Code for PIT added.
With the interrupts and the PIC added, a sleep function has been added to the kernel. 
For some reason VIRTUALBOX does not send the PIC signals at its programed frequency. 
This will be looked in to very soon. Lots of code added to the source tree.


-- Alpha 1.0.2 2017-02-10
Finally finished setting up the first easiest possible global descriptor table. Added 
support for writing decimal numbers (on none hex form), via the printf function with the 
%u flag (u = unsigned).

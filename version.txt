 - Code for interrupts added.
 - Code for PIC added.
 - Code for PIT added.
With the interrupts and the PIC added, a sleep function has been added to the kernel. 
For some reason VIRTUALBOX does not send the PIC signals at its programed frequency. 
This will be looked in to very soon. Lots of code added to the source tree.

Finally finished setting up the first easiest possible global descriptor table. Added 
support for writing decimal numbers (on none hex form), via the printf function with the 
%u flag (u = unsigned).
